            At the time I was fighting Margit: The Fell Omen boss in Elden Ring, I was pretty
            aware of his moveset considering that i have beaten him in a previous attempt. As
            I was fighting Margit, something badass happened. Both of us were 1 shot, but we 
            both decided to give the last swing. It is shown in the last clip of the video.

        <pre id="para">               I play Elden Ring a lot
            But I also love to edit videos so I wanted to make an edit. I travelled
            to Miquella's Haligtree and got into its roots where Malenia: Blade of Miquella
            boss fight was. I am still stuck at Malenia boss fight but I decided to give her
            an edit.
